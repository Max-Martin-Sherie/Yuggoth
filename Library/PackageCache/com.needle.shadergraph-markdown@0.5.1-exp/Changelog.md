# Changelog
All notable changes to this package will be documented in this file.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.5.1-exp] - 2021-02-10
- fixed texture field not being square in some cases
- added tiling/offset inline drawer. Usage:
  ```
  _MyTexture && (Texture2D)
  _MyTexture_ST (Vector)
  ```
- added texture keyword helpers - bool keywords with the same name as a texture will automatically be set on texture changes.
  This helps with performance improvements (making variants without texture access). Usage:
  ```
  _BumpMap (Texture2D)
  _BUMPMAP (Bool Keyword) // will be set automatically depending on texture being set
  ```

## [0.5.0-exp] - 2021-02-02
- fixed errors on non-ShaderGraph HDRP shaders (e.g. from Amplify)
- fixed UI not refreshing when changing some shader properties
- fixed duplicate split line before Additional Options
- changed inline texture format to "&" for inline texture and "&&" for inline texture + property
- added ability to make foldouts closed by default, just append "-"

## [0.4.5-exp] - 2021-01-30
- added shorthand for InlineTexture and VectorSliders - append & to property name
- fixes and better error display for incorrect drawer usage

## [0.4.4-exp] - 2021-01-18

- added ability for drawers to specify which properties are used by them / should be hidden
- added InlineTexture drawer

- added samples for all of the above in the SRP10-ShaderGraph
- improved performance of MarkdownShaderGUI by caching some things 

## [0.4.3-exp] - 2021-01-17
- fixed confusing reference naming of bool keywords
- added support for bool values in conditional properties
